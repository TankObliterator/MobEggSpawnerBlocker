Tank's MobEggSpawnerBlocker
====================
My updated version of [this plugin](https://github.com/Sothatsit/MobEggSpawnerBlocker) to propperly support 1.21.11.

**Disclosure:** I used Google Gemini to assist me with this as I am still very new to java.

Block players changing spawners using mob eggs

Paper seems to have added this functionality nativly with `disable-mob-spawner-spawn-egg-transformation:` in `paper-world-defaults.yml`.
